# ðŸŽ“ Exam Seating Arrangement System with Automated Email Notification

## ðŸ“„ ABSTRACT
The **Exam Seating Arrangement System with automated Email Notification** is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the process of allocating seating for students during examinations.

Traditional methods of managing seating arrangements often involve manual work, which is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks flexibility for dynamic changes. This system leverages technology to ensure **efficiency, accuracy**, and **scalability** in the seating arrangement process.

The project incorporates a **user-friendly frontend** interface built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, allowing administrators to input essential details such as hall capacity, seating order (row/column-wise), and the number of departments participating in the exam.

The **backend**, developed using **Node.js and Express**, processes these inputs to generate seating plans dynamically.  
**Data management** is handled through integration with **MySQL or MongoDB**, ensuring secure and efficient storage of student, department, and seating plan information.

A key feature of the system is its ability to **send seating details**, including hall and seat numbers, to students via **email**. This is achieved using **Nodemailer**, **SMTP**, or **Firebase** for communication.

> This automated notification mechanism reduces administrative effort while enhancing communication transparency.

The proposed system aims to address common challenges in examination logistics, such as:
- Managing large student groups
- Accommodating last-minute changes
- Ensuring fairness in seat allocation
